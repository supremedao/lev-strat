        Scenario 1: The Strategy health is less than `threshold`
                    In this scenario the Strategy Health has fallen below the set `threshold`
                    Rebalancing should occur to unwind some of the debt positions.

        Why don't we store `strategyHealth` locally and check against that?
        `controller.health()` gives us an up to date value for the strategy's health.
        This value is true at that block. 

        Note the assumption: the only way that `health` deteriorates is if the `wstETH` price falls

        There should be no other way in the protocol for the user to alter the `health` of the strategy.
        
        If the user `withdraws`, then they can only withdraw in proportion; they clear their debt and withdraw,
        i.e. no change in health. 

        If the user `deposits`, then the shares minted are in proportion to the `wstETH` provided, with a slight buffer.
